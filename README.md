# Ride Sharing Data Challenge

## Overview of the Project:
The purpose of this project is to apply my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to do the following: 1)Create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type; 2) Create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results.

    - The total rides, total fares, and total drivers for urban cities far exceeds the data for suburban and rural cities.
    - the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are higher in rural and suburban cities, as compared to urban cities.

## Summary
I would make the following recommendations to the CEO to address any disparities among the city types:

1) It is important that all rides, regardless of city type, have the same rate per mile.

2) It is also important that all drivers are paid the same hourly rate to ensure no disparity by city type.

3) Each city should have access to drivers in direct proportion to the demand of riders.
